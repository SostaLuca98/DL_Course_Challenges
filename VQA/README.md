# Visual Question Answering

The dataset is composed by synthetic scenes in which people and objects interact, and by corresponding questions, which are about the content of the images. Given an image and a question, the goal is to provide the correct answer.

The task is, in fact, a classification problem on 58 classes where the input is made of an image and a question, so we had to create two different models, a CNN for the images and an RNN for the text, and then combine them together.
