# Image Segmentation

The objective of this second challenge lies in the framework of the 1st ACRE Cascade Competition where the aim is to build a Neural Network able to simultaneously identify the crop from the weed and to segment it in the image. 

There are 4 different robots (BipBip, Weedelec, Roseau, Pead) that take photos of 2 crops (Haricot and Mais) each one with its peculiarities.
